# LaserProject
Personal Project I worked on during august to september 2024

To do this project I used a mixture of hardware and software
The main components I used were:
2 5V servo motors,
1 5V Laser,
3 5V Power supplies, (the connectors dont matter)
1 Breadboard,
10-12 DuPont wires, (can be bought in packs of 40 for about â‚¬3 euro)


This is all the essential equipment I used to build this project.

I plan on updating this readme file with the process of creating it and instructions along with pictures later.
